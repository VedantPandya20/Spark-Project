# Decision Tree Classifier â€“ Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates **prediction using a Decision Tree Classifier**. 
The main goal is to train a model that can **predict the correct class** of iris flowers when new data is provided.

## Dataset
We use the **Iris dataset**, which includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to classify iris species.

## Objective
- Build and train a **Decision Tree model**.
- Make predictions on **new, unseen data**.
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.

## Skills & Tools
Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning, Decision Trees
